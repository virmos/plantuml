# ***Overview***
Elastic load balancing
Target group:
    EC2 instances
    ECS tasks
    lambda functions
    ip addresses
Route table (rules):
    - path url
    - hostname in url
    - query string, parameters

# ***Types***
1. Overview
Network Load Balancer has one static IP address per AZ and you can attach an Elastic IP address to it. Application Load Balancers and Classic Load Balancers as a static DNS name
2.  
Application load balancer
    HTTP, HTTPS, Websocket
        Latency: 400ms
Network load balancer
    TCP, SSL, UDP
        Latency: 100ms
        Has 1 static IP for 1 AZ
Gateway load balancer
    Ip protocol
        GENEVE protocol
